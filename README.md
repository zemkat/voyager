Voyager
=======

Tools for the Ex Libris Voyager integrated library system.

* `get_items.php` -- List the item records for a given MFHD
* `get_lost_marc.sh` -- Pull replaced/deleted records from Voyager server

PHP tools use oracle (11g) for php (5.4). The connection information to the voyager database is stored in a file called `passwd.php` and a sample file is provided in `passwd.php.txt`
